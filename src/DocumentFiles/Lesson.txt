Q: What is an Expression?
Ans. The expression is the code segment that is no the right side of the equals sign
in an assignment or declaration statement.

java primitive types:

----------------------------------------------------------------
Whole number          |  Real number(Floating poing or Decimal) |
                      |                                         |
-----------------------------------------------------------------
    byte               |                                        |
    Short              |         float                          |
    int                |        double                          |
    long               |                                        |
-----------------------------------------------------------------
    Single Character    |   Boolean Value                       |
-----------------------------------------------------------------
        char            |       boolean                         |
                        |                                       |

Q: Why should we choose double?
Ans: First, it's actually faster to process on many modern computers.

    That's because computers have, at the chip level, the functionality to actually
    deal with these double numbers faster than the equivalent float.

    Second, the java libraries that we'll get into later in the course,
    particularly math functions, are often written to process doubles and not floats,
    and to return the result as a double.

    java selected the double because its more precise, and it can handle a larger range of numbers.

Q: What is a method?
Ans: A method is a collection of statements, one or more, that performs an operation.

Q: What is the meaning of '=' sign and '==' sign?
Ans: '=' is an assignment operator and '==' is an Equality operator.

Q: What is a code block?
Ans: A code block allows more than one statement to be executed, in other words, a block of code.

Q: What is Method?
Ans: A method declares executable code that can be invoked, passing a fixed number of values as arguments.

Q: What is method overloading?
Ans: Method overloading occurs when a class has multiple methods, with
the same name, but the methods are declared with different parameters.
So we can execute a method with one name but call it with different
arguments.
java can resolve which method it needs to execute, based on the arguments
being passed, when the method is invoked.

Q: what is method signature?
Ans: A method signature consists of the name of the method, and the
uniqueness of the declaration of its parameters.

Q: While statement

while (condition){
    //statements
}

inside the curly braces, it will indicate the body of the while loop.

do{
// statements
} while(condition);

For a for loop:

    for(int i=0; i<100; i++){
        System.out.println("i = "+1);
    }

    if we convert to while loop:
    int i=0;
    while(i<100){
        System.out.println("i = "+1);
        i++;
    }

Q: What is an Object?
Ans: An object is called an instance of a particular class.

Q: Try and Catch

Ans: The try statement actually has two code bocks.
The first is declared directly after the try keyword, and this
code block end , and is followed by the declaration of the catch keyword.
The catch keyword includes own code block.

try {
// statements that might get errors
} catch (Excepteion e){
//code to 'handle' the exception
}

Q: What is a Constructor?
Ans: A Constructor is used in the creation of an object, that's an instance of a class.
Its a special type of code block that has a specific name and parameters, much like a method.
It has the same name as the class itself, and it doesn't return any values.

If a class contains no constructor declarations, then a default constructor is implicitly declared.
